## 👋🏾 About Me

Hey there! My name's Ashenafee, but most people know me as Ash. I'm a graduate student pursuing an MSc in Applied Computing at the University of Toronto, specializing in Data Science for Biology. My work bridges biology and computer science, with a focus on understanding neural circuits and social behavior using computational tools.

## 📚 Education & Affiliation

I'm currently part of the [Lin Lab](https://lin.csb.utoronto.ca/) in the Department of Cell & Systems Biology at UofT, where I develop tools to analyze zebrafish social behavior. Previously, I collaborated with the [Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP)](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) in the Department of Computer Science, working on VR tools to enable rapid prototyping. I also hold an Honours BSc in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology with majors in Computer Science and Neuroscience.

## ⚙️ Current Projects

Here are some of the projects I’m actively working on:

- **socialiZe**: A web app to simulate and analyze zebrafish social behavior.
- **larvalabeler**: A Python package for semi-automated labeling of zebrafish larvae images to accelerate image annotation.
- **movector**: A TypeScript library for animating shapes along paths with fish-like motion.

If you don’t see a link to a project, it’s likely part of ongoing research or private collaboration. I’m a big proponent of open-source software and aim to make my work publicly available whenever possible.
