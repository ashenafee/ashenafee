## 👋🏾 About Me

Hey! My name's Ashenafee, but most people know me as Ash.

## 📚 Education & Affiliation

I'm studying Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, Computer Science, and Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. Alongside my usual coursework, I work on social behaviour in zebrafish with the [Lin Lab](https://lin.csb.utoronto.ca/) in the Department of CSB at UofT, as well as creating prototyping tools as a member of the [DGP Lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) in the Department of CS at UofT.

## ⚙️ Current Projects

I'm working on a couple of projects right now, including:

- socialiZe: A web app to help manipulate and analyze the social behaviour of zebrafish.
- **[Bridge](https://github.com/ashenafee/bridge)**: A toolkit to help speed up evolutionary biology workflows.

If you don't see a link to a project, don't worry! That means it's either part of my studies/research or the work is not public yet. I'm always for open-sourcing software and will do so whenever possible!
